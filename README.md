## Purpose
Here you can find some of my solutions to popular Leetcode problems. The way I approach Leetcode problems is by first solving the problem myself, and then solving it again after looking at the best solutions.

## Resources
I've used the following resources while practicing leetcode:
 - [The Famous Blind 75 Leetcode Problems](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)
 - [YouTube Playlist with Blind 75 Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLot-Xpze53ldVwtstag2TL4HQhAnC8ATf)
 - [Presentation on How to Prepare for Technical Interviews](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Y2NBqbz-11Dnwfbaf0iwD9NzyfgePFgcc_FOPAnbqY/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00)

## Tips
1. Try to practice a good variety of Leetcode questions (ex. Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Hash Tables, Graphs, Dynamic Programming)
2. Understand the patterns! This is the key to being able to solve coding problems on interviews.
3. If you have time, I suggest trying out a problem yourself first. Give it your best shot. Only once you've solved it or given it enough thought, should you check the solutions.
4. Really try to understand the solutions! Interviewers won't be impressed with brute force approaches to problems. They want to see solutions that are optimized and elegant. 
5. Think about time & space complexity. If your solution is O(n<sup>2</sup>), can you bring it down to O(n) or O(n*log(n)), etc?
