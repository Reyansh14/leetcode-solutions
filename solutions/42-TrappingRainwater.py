Notes: 
The amount of water trapped above a bar depends on the shorter of the tallest 
bars to its left and right. To calculate water above each bar, you need to know:
- The tallest bar to its left (leftMax).
- The tallest bar to its right (rightMax).
Water trapped = min(leftMax, rightMax) âˆ’ height[i].

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
